# Automatic Teaching Tasks Assignment Scheduler Sub-system

The Automatic Teaching Tasks Assignment Scheduler Sub-system is a software solution designed to streamline the process of assigning tasks to teachers in an educational setting. The goal of this project is to automate the task of assigning tasks to teachers based on a variety of factors, such as teacher skills, workload, and availability. The system will be capable of considering multiple constraints and objectives to ensure that each teacher is assigned tasks that are both suitable and manageable.
